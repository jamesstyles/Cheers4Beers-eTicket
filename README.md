# Cheers4Beers-eTicket
A test website offering e- tickets for a local beer festival

#The plan:
# Host a website on EC2 selling tickets
# Sales recorded to a database hosted on EC2
# Sales compose and send an email to the customer containing a unique QR or barcode
# Create an Android app that will scan the code, call an API to query the database and update the number of reads to restrict each ticket to one entry
